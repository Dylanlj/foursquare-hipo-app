to do list

proper css for everything
implement sass?
venue list items containers for the name text is falling outside of the container
the grid you're using for venues should probably actually have 3 columns
clicking on previous searches should bring up those results
may not use display venue, may have to get rid of that file
need to adjust photo grid to include 12 instead of 5 for the display venue

shouldn't have the the pointer show up on the display venue photo list

each time we make a api call for venue details were setting state, probably unnecessary

throwing errors if the establishment has no photos


git clone
npm install
create a .env file and add foursquare keys to it
npm start
